# opr-paas-capabilities

## Goal

The [PaaS operator](https://github.com/belastingdienst/opr-paas) is meant to deliver all that one application requires,
such as:

- one or more static application namespaces
- one or more dynamic application namespaces (for e2e tests of pull requests on the app including all requirements of the app)
- capabilities such as tekton, ArgoCD, grafana, etc.
- security (group permissions, Cluster Role Bindings, etc.)
- quota

Paas Capabilities are freely programmable, and this repo is used as a catalogue for community members
that would like to develop and contribute capabilities.
